This directory contains tutorials for single-structure refinement (`1-refinement`) and ensemble modelling (`2-ensemble`) with EMMIVOX.
The system that we are going to simulate is a Tau filament resolved at 1.9 Angstrom by the Scheres group
 (PDB 7P6A, EMD 13223). The system is composed by 5 identical chains, for a total of 8335 solute atoms.
We will simulate the system using the CHARMM36m force field in explicit TIP3P water, for a total of 40958 atoms. The reference is:

**Note 1**: To do ensemble modelling you need to first complete the single-structure refinement tutorial.

**Note 2**: Tutorials `3-refinement-wat` and `4-ensemble-wat` are still experimental.
