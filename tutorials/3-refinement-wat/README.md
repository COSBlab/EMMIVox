# Tutorial for single-structure refinement with EMMIVox
These are the steps for refining a single structural model into a cryo-EM maps with EMMIVox.
Each step of the procedure will be carried out in a separate directory.

**Note**: all the python scripts are contained in [`scripts`](https://github.com/maxbonomi/EMMIVox/tree/main/scripts).

## 0. System setup

   * Create the topology files and the initial conformation in GROMACS format starting from the deposited PDB (`7P6A.pdb`). We have done this for you using [CHARMM-GUI](https://www.charmm-gui.org). CHARMM-GUI can also complete your system if there are missing residues and create the force field for a small-molecule, if present.

      **Note**: The conformation in the `step3_input.gro` file (GROMACS format) produced by CHARMM-GUI is identical to one in the deposited PDB.
                However, CHARMM-GUI will probably translate and rotate your initial PDB, which will then not fit the input cryo-EM map anymore. Furthermore, atoms order might be different.

   * CHARMM-GUI renumbers residues and chains in `step3_input.gro`, so we first need to make sure we have a PDB file consistent with the `gro`
     atom order. We can create this PDB file using this command:

     `bash renumber.sh step3_input.gro step3_input.pdb`

   * Add the following custom groups to the index file created by CHARMM-GUI (`index.ndx`). You can create them with `make_ndx.py` in [`scripts`](https://github.com/maxbonomi/EMMIVox/tree/main/scripts) using [MDAnalysis](https://www.mdanalysis.org) selection syntax:

       * `System-WAT`: the ordered waters (residues 380-455) and a water buffer of 3.5 Ang around them.
          Waters require a special treatment when building the `index.ndx` file, therefore we need to use the flag `--water`:

         `python make_ndx.py step3_input.gro "resid 380 to 455 or same resid as (resname TIP3 and around 3.5 resid 380 to 455)" System-WAT --ndx index.ndx --water`

       * `System-PRO`: the protein.

         `python make_ndx.py step3_input.gro "protein" System-PRO --ndx index.ndx`

       * `System-MAP`: all the atoms that will be used to generate the cryo-EM map, i.e. the protein, the ordered water molecules, and the water buffer. Hydrogen atoms and the carboxylate oxygens of glutamic/aspartic acid will be automatically removed from this group, as they are not used in PLUMED to calculate the cryo-EM map.

         `python make_ndx.py step3_input.gro "protein or resid 380 to 455 or (same resid as (resname TIP3 and around 3.5 resid 380 to 455))" System-MAP --ndx index.ndx`

       * `System-XTC`: all the atoms that will be written to the GROMACS trajectory file (xtc format).
          In this case, we want to write all the atoms used for the cryo-EM calculation plus hydrogen and carboxylate oxygens of glutamic/aspartic acid.
 
         `python make_XTC_ndx.py System-MAP-H --ndx index.ndx`

       **Note**: If you have a small molecule or other non-protein (and non-water) atoms that you want to include in the cryo-EM map restraint,
                 please add them to the [MDAnalysis](https://www.mdanalysis.org) selections for the `System-PRO` and `System-MAP` groups.

   **Working directory**: `0-Building`

## 1. Map preparation

   * At this stage we need to download the cryo-EM full map [`emd_13223.map`](https://ftp.wwpdb.org/pub/emdb/structures/EMD-13223/map/emd_13223.map.gz),
     the two half-maps [`emd_13223_half_map_1.map`](https://ftp.wwpdb.org/pub/emdb/structures/EMD-13223/other/emd_13223_half_map_1.map.gz)
     and [`emd_13223_half_map_2.map`](https://ftp.wwpdb.org/pub/emdb/structures/EMD-13223/other/emd_13223_half_map_2.map.gz),
     and the PDB [`7P6A.pdb`](https://files.rcsb.org/download/7P6A.pdb), which will be needed to zone the density map close to the model (optional, but speeds up things a lot).

   * To convert the input cryo-EM map to PLUMED format, calculate an error map from the two half maps, and optionally filter voxels by correlation, you need to execute this:

      `python cryo-EM_preprocess.py emd_13223.map 0.9 emd_plumed.dat --zone 3.5 --zone_PDB 7P6A.pdb --zone_sel "protein" --halfmaps emd_13223_half_map_1.map emd_13223_half_map_2.map > log.preprocess`

       **Note 1**: The two half maps should be registered (aligned and with the same grid parameters). If they are not, you can use this command to register them:

       `python map_registration.py emd.map emd_half_map_1.map`

       `python map_registration.py emd.map emd_half_map_2.map`

       **Note 2**: The value `0.9` is the cutoff to exclude correlated voxels (above this threshold). If you want to keep all the voxels of the input map, set this to `1.0`. `emd_plumed.dat` is the name of the output map in PLUMED format. `--zone` can be used to keep only voxels within a certain distance (here 3.5 Ang) from the model specified by `--zone_PDB`.

       **Note 3**: If you want to give a look at the map after the preparation, you can inspect `emd_plumed.mrc`. This is the map that will be used in PLUMED for modelling and corresponds to `emd_plumed.dat`.

   * Now we align the cryo-EM map in PLUMED format (`emd_plumed.dat`) to the GROMACS conformation (`step3_input.pdb`). This is needed because CHARMM-GUI probably moved the initial structure during system setup. 

      `python align-VOXELS.py ../0-Building/step3_input.pdb 7P6A.pdb emd_plumed_aligned.dat emd_plumed.dat --ref_sel "backbone" --mobile_sel "backbone and not altLoc B and not (name O and resid 379)"`

       **Note 4**: Since there are some discrepancies between the number of atoms in the two PDBs, we have specified a selection of common atoms for alignment using [`MDAnalysis`](https://www.mdanalysis.org) selection syntax. `--ref_sel` refers to `step3_input.pdb` and `--mobile_sel` to `7P6A.pdb`. You can verify that the alignment is correct by checking the RMSD value in output: it should be zero as the two models are identical.

## 2. System equilibration

We need to prepare the system with an energy minimization and equilibration at room temperature. No cryo-EM restraints will be used at this stage.

   * Run energy minimization:

     `gmx_mpi grompp -f 0-em-steep.mdp -c ../0-Building/step3_input.gro -p ../0-Building/topol.top -o em.tpr`

     `gmx_mpi mdrun -pin on -deffnm em`

   * At this stage we store the energy-minimized conformation in a PDB file called `step3_input_xtc.pdb` with only the atoms in the 
     group `System-XTC` (those saved in the GROMACS trajectory file).

     `echo System-XTC | gmx_mpi trjconv -f em.gro -n ../0-Building/index.ndx -o ../3-Map-Scaling/step3_input_xtc.pdb -pbc nojump -s em.tpr`

   * We need to create additional restraints for the water molecules, which will be written to the `plumed_posres.dat` file. 
     These PLUMED restraints will keep the ordered waters in their positions as in `7P6A.pdb` (`--equil`) and the buffer within a radius of 8 Angstrom from a reference
     atom belonging to the protein backbone:

     `python add-POSRES.py ../3-Map-Scaling/step3_input_xtc.pdb "resid 380 to 455" 8.0 --ndx ../0-Building/index.ndx --equil`

   * Do a 1-ns NPT equilibration with positional restraints on protein atoms and water:

     `gmx_mpi grompp -f 1_npt_posres.mdp -c em.gro  -n ../0-Building/index.ndx -p ../0-Building/topol.top -r em.gro -o npt_posres.tpr -maxwarn 1`

     `gmx_mpi mdrun -pin on -deffnm npt_posres -nsteps 500000 -plumed plumed_posres.dat`

   * Do a 2-ns NVT equilibration with positional restraints on protein atoms and water:

     `gmx_mpi grompp -f 2_nvt_posres.mdp -c npt_posres.gro -n ../0-Building/index.ndx -p ../0-Building/topol.top -r em.gro -o nvt_posres.tpr -maxwarn 1`

     `gmx_mpi mdrun -pin on -deffnm nvt_posres -nsteps 1000000 -plumed plumed_posres.dat`

   **Working directory**: `2-Equilibration`

## 3. Optimizing the cryo-EM map scaling factor

   We postprocess the NVT equilibration trajectory to obtain an optimal scaling factor between experimental and predicted map. 
   
   `bash optimize_scale.sh 8`

   Here we are using 8 CPU cores (and the GPU) to postprocess the trajectory with PLUMED. The optimal value of the scale will be printed in `BEST_SCALE` at the end of the optimization. This will be used for both single-structure refinement and ensemble modelling.

   **Note**: If you have a monomeric protein or a heterocomplex, you need to edit `plumed_EMMI_template_BFACT.dat` before executing the `optimize_scale.sh` script
             and comment the line starting with `BFACT_NOCHAIN`. This option is used here since we are modelling 5 identical chains and 
             we want the Bfactor of the same residue in different chains to be equal.

   **Working directory**: `3-Map-Scaling`


## 4. Production

   To run the production simulation for single-structure refinement we need to:

   * Prepare the `plumed_EMMI.dat` file with production parameters using:

     `bash prepare_PLUMED_input.sh`

     **Note**: If you have a monomeric protein or a heterocomplex, you need to edit `plumed_EMMI_template.dat` before executing the `prepare_PLUMED_input.sh` script
               and comment the line starting with `BFACT_NOCHAIN`. This option is used here since we are modelling 5 identical chains and
               we want the Bfactor of the same residue in different chains to be equal.

   * We need to create additional restraints for the water molecules, which will be different from the ones using during equilibration.
     In production, these PLUMED restraints will keep both ordered waters and the buffer within a radius of 8 Angstrom from a reference
     atom belonging to the protein backbone:

     `python add-POSRES.py ../3-Map-Scaling/step3_input_xtc.pdb "resid 380 to 455" 8.0 --ndx ../0-Building/index.ndx`

   * Run a 10-ns long production run following the instructions below, after setting the number of CPU cores to use (`$OMP_NUM_THREADS`).

     `gmx_mpi grompp -f 4-nvt-production.mdp -c ../2-Equilibration/nvt_posres.gro -n ../0-Building/index.ndx -p ../0-Building/topol.top -o production.tpr`

     `gmx_mpi mdrun -pin on -deffnm production -ntomp $OMP_NUM_THREADS -nsteps 5000000 -plumed plumed_EMMI.dat`

   **Working directory**: `4-Production`

## 5. Postprocessing and validation

   **Note**: You do not need to perfom these actions if you are interested only in ensemble modelling.
    
   * We first need to extract the conformation with best EMMIVox score from our production run and perform a short energy minimization. To setup all the files needed for minimization, you need to execute this script:
     
     `bash prepare_PLUMED_input_emin.sh`

     **Note**: If you have a monomeric protein or a heterocomplex, you need to edit `plumed_EMMI_emin_template.dat` before executing the `prepare_PLUMED_input_emin.sh` script
               and comment the line starting with `BFACT_NOCHAIN`. This option is used here since we are modelling 5 identical chains and
               we want the Bfactor of the same residue in different chains to be equal. 

   * Now we run energy minimization using 8 CPU cores:
    
     `bash run_PLUMED_emin.sh 8`

   * After minimization is complete, we need to align `conf_pbc.pdb` to the original cryo-EM map using the `transformation.dat`
     file created during the map preparation stage:

     `python align-PDBs.py conf_pbc.pdb conf_pbc_aligned.pdb ../1-Map-Preparation/transformation.dat`

   * Finally, we add the BFactors column to our aligned model:

     `python add-BFACT.py conf_pbc_aligned.pdb EMMIStatus conf_EMMIVOX.pdb`

   * The output PDB file `conf_EMMIVOX.pdb` is ready to be validated with PHENIX:

     `bash do_PHENIX conf_EMMIVOX.pdb ../1-Map-Preparation/emd_13223.map 1.9 > results.EMMIVOX`
   
     where `1.9` is the resolution of the input map `emd_13223.map` in Angstrom. Validation metrics are saved in `results.EMMIVOX`.

   * Compare the EMMIVOX-refined model with the deposited PDB:

      `bash do_PHENIX ../1-Map-Preparation/7P6A.pdb ../1-Map-Preparation/emd_13223.map 1.9 > results.PDB`
